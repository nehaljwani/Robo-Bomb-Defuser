#+TITLE: ITWS2 FALL SPRING 2012 ASSIGNMENT 4

* Student Details:
** Name: Nehal J. Wani
** Roll No: 201125005

* Code Organization:
   - The whole program is divided into 2 Parts ::
       Part 1 contains the mail python code.
       This contains the program which controls the flow.
       Part 2 contains text files containing ascii art.
       These contain images for add-on effect.
 
* Class Decomposition:
** My code has five classes :: 
*** Class1. curses\_screen
 -  Used for making a screen on which components of game can be displayed. Contains the methods \_\_enter\_\_ and \_\_exit\_\_ so that =with= keyword can be used to 
    implement objects. Initializes a screen and returns with basic parameters.
#+begin_src python 
  class curses_screen:
	""" Creates A Screen """
	def __enter__(self):
		self.stdscr = curses.initscr()
		curses.cbreak()
		self.stdscr.clear()
		curses.noecho()
		self.stdscr.keypad(1)
		self.stdscr.border(0)
		return self.stdscr
	def __exit__(self,a,b,c):
		curses.echo()
		curses.endwin()
		self.stdscr.getch()
		self.stdscr.clear()
		self.stdscr.refresh()
#+end_src
*** Class2. curses\_window
 -  Used for generating a window in which the arena is displayed. Just returns an initialized window.
#+begin_src python
class curses_window:
	""" Creates A Window """
	def __init__(self):
		curses.curs_set(0)
		curses.noecho()
		self.win=curses.newwin(LINES-4,COLS-4,2,2)
		self.win.clear()
		self.win.refresh()
		self.win.keypad(1)
#+end_src     
*** Class3. Gun 
 -  Used for putting guns [big and small] on the game arena.
**** Method1: fire\_small :: Calculate Position Of Small Bullet 
**** Method2: getBullPos :: Firing Small Bullet
**** Method3: fire\_big :: Calculate Position Of Big Bullet
**** Method4: clear :: Clear game window
*** Class4. Robot
**** Method1: place :: Place Robot @ Given Coordinates 
**** Method2: move :: Move Robot @ Given Coordinates
 
 -  Used for generating upto 10 types of different robots and perform operations such as move and place
*** Class5. MyGame which inherits from curses\_window
 -  Used for starting the game as it contains the necessary components and methods for the game to run
**** Method1: Pause :: Simple Pause
**** Method2: Display\_Hash :: Display Animated Hash when bomb explodes
**** Method3: Display\_Crash :: Display Flashing Effect when robot moves out of bounds
**** Method4: Start :: Heart of the program
**** Method5: End :: Ends the game
**** Method6: Loading :: Loading a particular level with ascii art
**** Method7: Display\_Choice :: Display Choices When Robot Dies 
     
* Advantages:
- The design of classes makes the code short as objects have similar properties can be initialized with just one coommand
- The code is flexible enough for re-use for a different GUI or game with different logic as the code is fully documentated and is quite freindly

* Miscellaneous:
   -  The Control Flow ::
      First, the main screen is displayed and robots are selected. Out of 10 choices, a robot can be selected. Then the required screens are initialized for the game
      Arena. Different elements accourding to level are put and animated accordingly.
   -  The Main Logic ::
      The main logic resides in the Start Function of the The Class MyGame. It contains all the specifications of the control flow.

* Extra Features:
  -  The ASCII Art ::
      ASCII ART has been added to improve the loks of the game
  -  Variuos Levels ::
      The game contains 3 levels with increasing level of difficulty
  -  Guns & Timeout ::
      There are weapons which interfere the motion of the robot. The bomb has to defused within a specific time range which varies according to level
